            //TODO: On the About Us, could we change the layout slightly so that we have space for a portrait photo each with a body of text next to it and then a main body of text below it all ? I have pasted a rough example of what I mean on another website: http://www.bellevuelettings.co.uk/About_Us/
            //TODO: Could we possibly have a black footer type thing at the bottom of each page that will have our address, email address, phone number and Letting Agent Registration Number: LARN1809015.With new legislation we have to have out letting agent registration number on all correspondence and website etc.
